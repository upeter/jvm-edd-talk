# Comparing runs

The diff view shows you what changed between two runs of the same experiment, item by item, so you can see what a change moved before it ships.

It is the same comparison the [CI gate](./ci-gate) and [regression alerting](./alerting) act on, shown as a table you can read.

## Get a diff in one call

Compare a candidate run against a baseline run:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/experiments/{experimentId}/runs/{candidateRunId}/diff?baselineRunId={baselineRunId}'
```

You get back a summary (the headline movement) and a page of cases (one row per item).

Two roles matter here:

- The **candidate** is the run under review (the new side).
- The **baseline** is what you compare against (the old side, usually the previous successful run).

`baselineRunId` is required. Both runs must be terminal. Comparing an in-flight run would be misleading, so the API returns 409 if either run has not finished.

## Open the diff in the UI

From a run, open the comparison against its baseline. You land on this page in the web UI:

```
/experiments/{experimentId}/runs/{candidateRunId}/diff
```

The candidate is the run you opened. The baseline is the run you compare it against.

## Filter the case list

By default the case list returns every item. Add the `status` parameter to narrow it:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/experiments/{experimentId}/runs/{candidateRunId}/diff?baselineRunId={baselineRunId}&status=REGRESSED'
```

| `status` value | Returns |
|----------------|---------|
| `ALL` (default) | Every item |
| `REGRESSED` | Items that got worse |
| `IMPROVED` | Items that got better |
| `CHANGED` | Items that regressed or improved |

The case list is pageable. Use the standard `page` and `size` query parameters.

## Read the summary

The summary reports the whole-run movement.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `baselinePassRate`, `candidatePassRate`, `passRateDelta` | Pass rate on each side, and candidate minus baseline |
| `significant` | Whether the pass-rate change is statistically significant, not noise |
| `improvedCount`, `regressedCount`, `unchangedCount` | How items moved between the runs |
| `addedCount`, `removedCount` | Items present in only one of the two runs |
| `pairing` | How items were matched: `dataset_item_id` (matched one to one by id) or `positional` (matched by position) |

## Read a case

Each case is one item compared across the two runs. A case carries:

- **`status`**: `REGRESSED`, `IMPROVED`, `UNCHANGED`, `ADDED`, or `REMOVED`.
- **`passFlip`**: `true` when the item flipped between pass and fail.
- **`input`**: the item's input text.
- **`evaluators`**: the per-evaluator deltas, so you can see which evaluator moved.

Each entry in `evaluators` has the evaluator `name`, its `baselineMean` and `candidateMean`, the `delta` (candidate minus baseline), a per-evaluator `status` (`IMPROVED`, `REGRESSED`, or `UNCHANGED`), and a `significant` flag for that evaluator's change.

## How significance gating works

A change counts as a regression only when it clears two bars:

1. It is beyond a small epsilon (not a rounding wobble).
2. It is statistically significant.

The test depends on the data:

- **McNemar's test** for single-run pass/fail flips.
- **A paired permutation test with a bootstrap interval** otherwise.

A noisy judge nudging one item does not register as a regression. That is what keeps the gate and alerts from flaking. The `significant` flag in the summary is that same gate, surfaced so you can tell a real move from sampling noise.

## Next steps

- [CI regression gate](./ci-gate): turn this comparison into a build pass or fail.
- [Regression alerting](./alerting): get a webhook when a comparison regresses.
